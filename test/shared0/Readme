This directory demonstrates the differences when building with static
and dynamic linking.

Run:
        make clean all check check-interception
and notice that under this header:
        check-interception/main_static cc1 ----------------------------------------
both main.c and shared.c are mentioned, whereas under this header
        check-interception/main_dynamic cc1 ----------------------------------------
only main.c is mentioned.

This means that when ld encounters unused ELF sections during static
linking, it concatenates them, whereas under dynamic linking it does
not.
